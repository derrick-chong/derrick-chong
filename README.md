Welcome to my page! I am a Microbiology & Immunology Honours student from the University of British Columbia. I am most passionate about scientific research which has taken me to four different labs spanning the subjects of ecology, botany, entomology, microbiology, geochemistry, cutaneous biology, and other health sciences.

I am also interested in science communication and education. I will be working on producing a podcast that features UBC scientists and UBC research in the upcoming 2019 school year. 


## science

I fell in love with understanding how things interact with one another. Some scientists call this study "ecology".

I started out in [Dr. Juli Carrillo's lab](https://lfs-carrillo.sites.olt.ubc.ca/) in the summer of 2017 to understand how certain agriculture pests interact with plants. 

Then I followed my love for plants to [Dr. Cara Haney's lab](https://haneylab.msl.ubc.ca/) where I worked on the plant microbiome in 2018. Here, I discovered a love for microbiome research. 

In May 2019, my particular interest in skin and passion for the microbiome flew me all the way to New England in [Dr. Julia Oh's lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-oh-lab) at the [Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine](https://www.jax.org/) in Connecticut.

Finally, sticking with the health sciences and still holding onto the microbiome tightly, I will return to UBC in September and join [Dr. Carolina Tropini's lab](http://tropini.microbiology.ubc.ca) to work on the gut microbiome.
