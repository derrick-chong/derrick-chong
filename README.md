Welcome to my page! I am a Microbiology & Immunology Honours student from the University of British Columbia. I am most passionate about scientific research which has taken me to four different labs spanning the subjects of ecology, botany, entomology, microbiology, geochemistry, cutaneous biology, and other health sciences. 


I am currently a Research Intern in [Julia Oh's lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-oh-lab) at the [Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine](https://www.jax.org/) in Connecticut.
